    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Yi Su but I just go by Red. I attended a program called the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART) to pursue my career in computer science. I can develop a website using a combination of basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Soon, I will be taking another coding course in Clovis West Highschool before graduating in 2023 and going off to college.</p>
    <p>Outside of school, I enjoy playing tabletop games, especially Dungeons and Dragon and Warhammer 40k. I have a thing for working with my hands. It started with Legos, and now building and painting miniatures. </p>
    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>Anime and especially manga has become a huge part of my life. It has changed my philosophical view of life and the world. It is a reminder for me to keep going and push towards the future. It is also a huge inspiration for creativity such as creating a character for Dungeons and Dragons. </p>

    <h2>The Future</h2>
    <p>After my junior year, I will probably go back to Taiwan during summer to reconcile with my family. I have decided not to take CART next year because of a new teacher being employed in the game design lab. Also, I want to take 4 AP classes during my senior year to make my college application look better.</p>
    <p> After high school, I want to go to college. I am hoping to get into UC or a good college to prove to my parents that I genuinely have been studying hard in school. I want to major in STEM or something computer related and settle down in life.</p>
