        <br>Brad Plumer and Henry Fountain
        <br>An Article from The New York Times
        <br>August 9, 2021
        <br><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/climate/climate-change-report-ipcc-un.html?smid=url-share" class="link">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/climate/climate-change-report-ipcc-un.html?smid=url-share</a>
    </p>
    <p class="text">The article “A Hotter Future Is Certain, Climate Panel Warns. But How Hot Is Up to Us” discusses climate change and how our world is being affected by it. People around the world are burning fossil fuels, cutting down trees, industry, cars, etc. that can spread greenhouse gasses. This has caused the planet’s temperature to rise about 1.1 degrees Celsius and will continue to rise over the years. This has led to an increase in temperature, ocean level rising, more pollution, and so on that forces scientists to find a solution from our creation.</p>
    <p class="text">This issue is very concerning, not only for our planet, but even I can see how our climate has been changing. This summer in California has been a lot hotter compared to every other summer and by going outside I can see how awful the air has been. But aside from my own personal findings, scientists have found that heat will rise 1.5 degrees Celsius in the next two decades no matter what type of strategy we have to prevent emission. This can also mean that currently, we can reach an increase of 2 degrees, 3 degrees, or even 4 degrees Celsius in the next few decades. An increase in heat can cause ocean levels to rise, more wildfires, and affect natural disasters. A rise in ocean level means more floods that can destroy homes of thousands, which increase poverty, and that means less productivity. Wildfires can burn down forests which reduce photosynthesis and the atmosphere can take gas elsewhere causing pollution. Heat increases the risks of droughts, floods, downpours, and reports show cyclones being more aggressive over 40 years, possibly from heat. If we don’t do anything to reduce heat, these problems will only keep increasing.</p>
    <p class="text">Thanks to scientists around the world, they have developed theories that can aid this cause. With computers ever-advancing, they are able to collect data to prevent future problems. But our current goal for the next two decades is to only increase the planet’s temperature by 1.5 degrees Celsius. It is impossible to go any lower because of industry, cars, and etc. In order to achieve that, every country needs to do a coordinated effort to stop the increase in greenhouse gas. Stop burning fossil fuels, stop clearing out forests, and really, reduce releasing greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. Many people have already been creating solutions to these problems such as electric cars. In the possible future, ways of removing gasses from the atmosphere will really contribute to the reduction of the earth’s heat.</p>

    <p class="text"><b>The Sins of an MMO Gamer</b></p>
    <p class="text">As video games become more accepted in the modern world, many gamers have fallen into many stereotypes or sins. Since I need to be specific about my topic and to increase my word count, I will be writing about MMO gamers. MMO or massively multiplayer online is a type of genre in a video game where the player can play in this online world filled with deep lore and story. It can be doing quests and fighting monsters (PvE) or fighting other players in real-time (PvP). Many of these MMO gamers have committed at least five sins that I will be talking about.</p>
    <p class="text">Imagine every day you pour hours and hours into this MMO you love. Getting the best loot, gear, etc, and then poof. All the items you work for, stolen in seconds. Greed is the most common sin that every gamer has committed. Scamming items out of new players for a lower price, stealing all the loot, hoarding items, and in-game currency. They will do anything for their own self-benefit. Even something harmless like grinding by yourself for an item you really want can be considered greedy. Greed is what makes them powerful or famous. Being greedy also can be related to sins like wrath, sloth, and lust.</p>
    <p class="text">Let me start by saying this, I think watching people argue is the funniest thing ever. Watching people get mad about something stupid and people throwing out stupid insults. I think it is hilarious and the same thing can be applied to MMO gamers. PvE in MMO however, is a very chill and relaxing way to pass time. But just every once in a while you will find these elitists that would get mad at others if they didn’t fight the monster properly or first trying puzzles. Greedy people that scam and hoard items can make someone angry. Also, the people that get trolled (an internet term for people intentionally messing with others) by others would sometimes get very mad especially if the results are devastating. PvP is just another species itself. Not coordinating with your team and being unskillful in battle can lead to someone typing a two-hundred 200 essay about how much of a bad player you are.</p>
    <p class="text">Sloth is the second most common in MMO. Outside of MMO, being lazy is probably a sin we all have committed since everything we want in this generation is just given to us. In most MMO genre games, however, the developers want the player to play for a long time. Most ultra-rare items require long hours of grinding or patience. Games like Warframe require you to wait in real-time for crafting or events. This is where the sin of sloth comes into play here. People that don’t have the patience can just buy the thing they want with real money. Even without money, players can just AFK (away from the keyboard) and wait until the event is over to get all the loot at the end. But the worst of all is the people that use Ais. AI allows a computer to control the player so they can get the best gear for them. This especially is annoying because they can fill up servers.</p>
    <p class="text">I think a lot of video games today draw in new players with their sexual and pretty character design. Especially with anime being more mainstream and fantasy characters being more popular, the lust for them will be even more. Why do you think the designer would put little amounts of clothing on a character? Was it an accident?  Of course not, it is to draw in lustful people that are interested. Most MMO games now have the option to customize your character into anything in your desire. Greed can be related since some players would collect hundreds of collectibles just to design your character. They can even find, request, or draw fanart of a specific character in a more sexual way.</p>
    <p class="text">Greed, sloth, and lust can all be somewhat connected to Envy. As a player, you would see another player with better and stronger gear. So you will become greedy to have the same gear as him or even better. But you might be lazy and copy strategies to quickly obtain the gear you want. Lust, you can be jealous of some other character customization, so you might take inspiration or copy there’s. Envy in MMO is mostly being jealous of something you don’t have yet.</p>
    <p class="text">In conclusion, all these sins I have listed are from what I’ve experienced throughout gaming. It can be something harmless like sloth, or annoying or funny like wrath. But at the end of the day, please don’t fall under the sin of lust because that is a one-way ticket to remove yourself from society.</p>
